<h3>CFHT observations made for OSSOS</h3>
The CFHT observations have a proprietary period of one year.

Initial plans are that the <a href="http://minorplanetcenter.net" target="_blank">Minor Planet Center</a> (MPC) will be sent all the observations of both new and already-MPC-listed trans-Neptunian objects that were made in a given semester six months after the end of that semester.

For our 2013A observations, this means an MPC submission at the end of January 2014.

A second MPC submission in August 2014 will provide the Feb-July 2014 recoveries of the 2013A and B detections.
